**Provenance.** Pass-structure numbers are 5 interleaved runs per arm, after a discarded warmup, of
`examples/forces-layout.mjs --bench` on chrome 150 / firefox 152; interval numbers are 3 runs per arm
of `examples/cpu-busywork.mjs --target node`. First-run numbers are cold-start outliers by a wide
margin (a single un-warmed run reads 18ms against a 7ms median, enough to "prove" the wrong
conclusion) — **always warm up and interleave** before believing a pass-structure A/B.

## What self-time actually includes

**[measured]** The headline fact, and it is not what "CPU profile" suggests.

On the browser lanes, `selfMs` is **JS plus the synchronous engine work that JS triggered** — not
pure JS. The CPU pass (tracing off) on the forced-layout probe:

```
8.41 ms   fn=run    examples/forces-layout.mjs:24
0.20 ms   fn=elementFromPoint   (native)
```

The probe's actual JavaScript is a couple dozen property reads — microseconds. But the trace pass
independently measures **7.17ms of forced layout**, and `run()`'s wall is 8.3ms. So ~85% of that
"JS self-time" **is the reflow**, attributed to the JS frame that forced it. The V8 sampler walks
the JS stack; time spent in Blink C++ under a DOM accessor lands on the calling JS frame.

Firefox does the same thing, and lands in the same place (`run()` at **8.79ms**).

This is **correct and useful**, not a bug: "delete this line and the page gets ~8ms faster" is
exactly the actionable answer. It also means `query cpu` already gives forced-layout attribution to
the *forcing* line on both engines — including on Firefox, where `query blame` gets it wrong (see
[engine-mapping.md](./engine-mapping.md#forced-layout-blame-differs-by-engine)).

But it constrains what may be claimed:

- **`--target node`**: no DOM, so self-time really is pure JS cost. The SSR / `renderToString`
  framing is accurate here and only here.
- **browser lanes** (`--bench`, driver): self-time is JS + synchronous engine work. Do not describe
  it as "pure JS cost".

## The pass plan

```
chrome:  [timing+sampler] [trace]
firefox: [timing]          [gecko]
node:    [node-cpu]
```

- **timing** — `categories: null`, tracing off. Clean wall/per-iteration times + CDP counters, and
  **the CPU sampler rides here** (see below). `--no-cpu-profile` takes the sampler back off.
- **trace** — full DevTools timeline incl. `invalidationTracking`. Counts, events, attribution.
  Durations here are distorted by instrumentation **by design**; timing comes from the timing pass.
  **The sampler must never run in this pass** (see below).
- **gecko** — firefox only; one Gecko-profiler run yields CPU samples *and* layout/style markers.

CPU profiling is **on by default on every target** and costs no extra pass. Opting out is only
meaningful on chrome: node has nothing left to measure without it, and firefox without it reports
every rendering count as 0, so the CLI refuses `--no-cpu-profile` on both.

`--no-isolate` collapses to the single trace pass, which the sampler cannot ride, so that
combination yields no CPU model and says so in `meta.notes`.

### Why the CPU pass is separate: tracing contaminates sampling

**[measured]** Sampling is cheap; it is not the reason the sampler needs an untraced pass.
**Tracing contaminating the sampler is.** The load-bearing property of the pass the sampler rides is
that tracing is off in it.

Folding the sampler into the trace pass:

| sampler runs in | passes | CPU self ms | CPU fns | perIteration ms |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a pass of its own | 3 | **8.67** (8.2–11.4) | 7 | **8.3** (8.0–8.7) |
| **trace pass** (never do this) | 2 | **10.4** (10.0–11.2) | **10** | 8.3 |
| timing pass (**shipped**) | 2 | 8.99 (8.3–13.3) | 7 | 9.1 (8.3–13.4) |

Trace-folding inflates CPU self-time **+21% with non-overlapping ranges** and invents functions.
The mechanism is our own trace config: `disabled-by-default-devtools.timeline.stack` makes Blink
capture a JS stack on every Layout/UpdateLayoutTree — *while JS is on the stack* — so the sampler
attributes trace-emission cost to the JS function that forced the layout. It is **not uniform**
(top fn +4%, total +21%), so `--by package` proportions shift too.

The insidious part: this lands on the **same frame** as the real forced-layout time described
above. From inside the folded pass the two are indistinguishable. One is production cost; the other
is measurement apparatus that exists only because we asked for it. Reporting 10.4ms for a line that
costs 8.4ms in production is precisely the fake number this project refuses elsewhere.

Counts are never at risk: `layoutCount`/`styleCount`/`forcedLayoutCount` are byte-identical
(22/23/43) across all 20 runs of the A/B.

### Do not "correct" the contamination arithmetically

It is tempting: the trace pass knows exactly which forced events fired on which source line, so a
per-line subtraction (~1.7ms / 43 events ~= 40us each) looks derivable. Don't. That constant is
**fitted, not measured** — it varies with stack depth — and it would inject a modeled correction
into the one signal the trust table calls "real: trustworthy in aggregate". Folding into the
**timing** pass removes the error instead of modelling it. Prefer the design where the number is
measured.

### Why it rides the timing pass

**[measured]** A cpu spec and the timing spec would be *the same pass* (`categories: null`),
differing only by the sampler. A pass of its own therefore buys isolation from the **timing** pass,
which is not what matters — isolation from **tracing** is, and the timing pass has that for free.

Riding there: 2 passes, **record wall 2.48s vs 3.68s (-33%)** against a separate cpu pass, CPU model
intact (+4%, overlapping ranges, same function count). The cost lands on wall instead:
**perIteration +10% median and ~3x the variance** at a 50us interval — most of which the 200us
default below buys back.

That trade respects the existing trust hierarchy — wall is declared *directional*, CPU self-time is
declared *real* — and systematic inflation cancels in `diff`, where both sides carry it. The timing
pass is therefore not pristine, which is what `--no-cpu-profile` is for: clean-wall and
`--iterations` benchmarking work.

### The sampler interval: why 200us

**[measured]** `50us` — **20x more aggressive than V8's own 1000us** — is where most of the
timing-fold's wall cost comes from.

Tuned against `examples/cpu-busywork.mjs` (**~2.2 seconds** of real JS), *not* the layout probe. A
layout probe is the wrong workload for tuning a JS sampler: it has ~8ms of JS, so any coarsening
starves it and looks catastrophic. Measuring on the probe suggests 200us "collapses" resolution from
7 functions to 3; on a real JS workload that effect does not exist.

| interval | self ms (median) | perIteration ms | functions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 50us | 2348.3 | 177.0 | 6 |
| **200us** | **2226.1** | **165.6** | **6** |
| 1000us | 2208.4 | 163.1 | 5 |

Reading it: 1000us is effectively the unperturbed baseline, so 50us **inflates its own measurement
by ~6%** and the wall it rides on by ~8.5%. 200us costs ~1%. And the resolution argument for 50us
does not survive contact: at 50us and 200us the function lists are **identical**, with self-% within
0.3pp (`run` 65.0 vs 64.7, `buildRows` 24.6 vs 24.4, `hashString` 3.6 vs 3.7). The only thing 50us
"finds" extra is sub-0.1ms noise like `now (node:internal/perf/performance)` at 0.0ms, and its
presence varies run to run.

So 200us: ~1% overhead, 5x V8's default resolution, and percentages — the thing `query cpu` actually
reports — stable across a 20x interval change. **Re-measure against a JS-heavy workload if you touch
it.**

`DEFAULT_CPU_INTERVAL_US` lives in `profile/cpuprofile.ts` and is imported by **both** lanes. One
definition, because a lane that declares its own drifts silently: nothing type-checks two constants
into agreement, so a change to the interval lands on one lane while the other keeps sampling at the
old rate and `--help` describes neither. A unit test asserts no lane redeclares it. If you add a
lane, import the constant.

## Firefox: samples and markers share a pass, unavoidably

The gecko pass collects markers *and* samples together — structurally the thing warned against
above, since `profiler_capture_backtrace()` fires on every invalidation. It cannot be separated:
the Gecko profiler is started via `MOZ_PROFILER_STARTUP*` env vars for the whole browser lifetime,
and the `js` feature that yields JS stacks for cause chains is the same feature that yields
samples. So Firefox's CPU model may carry contamination of the same shape as Chrome's trace-fold.

**This has not been measured.** It should be, before Firefox CPU numbers are described as clean.
The one data point that argues against a large effect: firefox `run()` = 8.79ms vs chrome's
uncontaminated 8.41ms, a 5% gap — but that is one probe and the two engines differ for other
reasons too.

### Firefox idle is on the CPU axis, not the category axis

**[measured]** Idle is NOT in Gecko's category axis: a fully-idle window records 0 Idle-category
and 0 null-stack samples, because the leaf frame while waiting is a native frame categorized `Other`
(so `geckoToRawCpuProfile` alone would bill the whole wait to `(program)`). The idle information
lives on a different axis: the per-sample `threadCPUDelta` column (how much CPU the thread actually
consumed since the previous sample). A descheduled thread reads ~0 there while wall-time advances, so
`idleMs = Σ(wall-delta where threadCPUDelta ~= 0)`.

That column is present only when the profiler runs with the `cpu` feature. An explicit
`MOZ_PROFILER_STARTUP_FEATURES` string REPLACES the default set, so `js` alone leaves the column
**0% populated**; `js,cpu` populates it **100%**. Probe:
`examples/awaits-only.mjs`, a `run()` that only awaits (`setTimeout` 20ms x 20, `--bench`), a
~pure-wait window:

| lane | window | idle reported |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome (CDP, 200us) | 614 ms | **610 ms (99%)** — `(idle)` samples fill the wait |
| Firefox (Gecko js,cpu, ~1ms) | 470 ms | **95.7% idle** — samples with `threadCPUDelta ~= 0` |

So the reconciling bar IS emitted on Firefox: `geckoToRawCpuProfile` routes each ~0-CPU sample to
`(idle)` (honest `scriptingMs`), and `computeGeckoCpuBreakdown` tiles the window
`js · style · layout · browser · gc · idle`, with style/layout from each sample's nearest-to-leaf
Layout-category frame. A dump without the CPU signal (an older recording, or js-only) carries no
idle signal, so no bar is emitted rather than a fabricated one. `cpuallthreads` is unnecessary
(`js,cpu` reproduces the idle result, sampling only registered threads) and `stackwalk` adds zero
signal. Paint stays off the bar: it is off-main-thread compositor work (a side track), never summed.

### Sub-frame CPU work IS measurable on both engines, off the frame-floor axis

**[measured]** `wall`/`INP` cannot resolve below one display frame ([frame-floor.md](./frame-floor.md)),
but CPU self-time can, in both engines, and reconciles with the independent `--bench` wall (the
summed timed `run()` samples) to ~1% on JS-bound work. Probe: `examples/fixed-js-work.mjs`, a fixed
~1.5ms JS loop, `--bench`.

| lane | iter=1 | iter=50 | reconciles with bench wall | resolution floor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome (200us sampler) | js 2.2 ms (bench 2.2) | js 74.1 ms (bench 73.4) | yes, ~1% | ~1.5ms call resolves at iter=1 (~10 samples) |
| Firefox (~1ms sampler) | scriptingMs 2.0 ms (bench 2) | scriptingMs 67.9 ms (bench 65) | yes, ~3% | needs a few ms accumulated; ~5ms over-count floor for near-zero work |

The sampler interval sets the floor: Chrome at 200us prices a single sub-millisecond call (though
at `--iterations 1` a sub-ms call can land 0 samples — the near-zero `console.log` probe
`examples/near-zero.mjs` reads js 0 at iter 10 and only becomes monotonic above ~200 iterations);
Firefox is pinned to Gecko's ~1ms floor
(`GECKO_MIN_INTERVAL_MS`), so a near-zero window reads a fixed ~5ms of a handful of samples and needs
higher `--iterations` before the number is trustworthy. Both prove the point: the work axis reports
what the one-frame `wall`/`INP` floor hides.

## Sourcemap note gating

The note answers "can the package rollup be believed?", which is a **different question** from "did
any sourcemap resolve?". Gating it on `resolved === 0` ("no sourcemap resolved") conflates the two
and lies in the most common case:

```
$ wpd record examples/forces-layout.mjs --bench
• WARNING: no sourcemap resolved ... CPU self-time is attributed to minified bundle names
Sourcemaps: 0/1 resolved ← packages below are minified bundles, not real packages
```

`forces-layout.mjs` is hand-written unbundled ESM. Nothing is minified, and every frame resolves to
`forces-layout.mjs:24`. It has no sourcemap because **it needs none**.

### The trigger needs TWO signals

Worth reading before touching this, because the obvious narrowing is wrong and its wrongness is
silent.

Gating on `CpuModel.unmappedFrames` alone — frames that fell back to an origin bucket — kills the
false positive **and the true positive**: a local frame *always* resolves to a path
(`makeSourceResolver` sets `frame.source` for every served file), so `unmapped: !isLocalPath` can
never fire for a local script. A minified `app.min.mjs` with no map — precisely what `vite build`
emits, since `build.sourcemap` defaults to `false` — is attributed to whatever `package.json` sits
above it and warns about **nothing**. That gap is invisible from the output, because "we know the
file path" and "we know whose code this is" are different facts and one flag cannot carry both.

So the condition is measured twice, at the two places the damage is actually done:

| signal | where | catches |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SourceMapDiagnostics.unmappedBundles` | `SourceMapResolver.diagnostics()` | a script that **is build output** (minified) whose map did not resolve — local *or* remote |
| `CpuModel.unmappedFrames` | `resolveCallFrame` | a frame with **no determinable owner**, bucketed by origin — remote only |

Neither alone is enough: a local minified bundle has `unmappedFrames === 0` (its path is known), and
an unminified remote script has `unmappedBundles === 0` (yet we still cannot say whose it is). The
note fires on either.

`unmapped` is set in `resolveCallFrame` at the point it falls back to `unmappedOriginBucket`, **not**
inferred afterwards from the package string: `(cdn.example.com)` is unmapped while `(native)` and
`(node)` are not, and telling those apart by pattern breaks on a dotless host (`(localhost)`).

**Known false negative:** `looksMinified` tests for a line over 500 chars, so a *small* minified
bundle whose lines all stay short reads as plain source and does not warn. Real build output is
nowhere near that (bundlers join whole modules onto one line — the repo's own test fixture lands at
1114 chars, and a react-dom bundle is orders beyond), so the gap is narrow and deliberate: the
alternative is guessing, and a warning that cries wolf on every hand-written module is worse than
one that misses a toy bundle.

Four unit tests pin all of it — remote unmapped bundle counts, node builtin does not, minified local
bundle counts, plain local source does not. Keep both directions genuinely covered: **when you
remove a false positive, the test that matters is the one proving the true positive still fires.**
